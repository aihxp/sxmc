## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- `sxmc serve --watch` for polling-based skill reloads during local development
- benchmark and launch docs for the current patch line, including reproducible CLI benchmark guidance

### Fixed

- Windows stdio command parsing fallback
- redundant skill discovery during CLI bridge flows

### Changed

- release metadata and package docs now align to `0.1.4`
- benchmark findings now explicitly call out that `--watch` is outside the default one-shot benchmark path

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- `--prompt` and `--resource` support for `sxmc stdio` and `sxmc http`
- safer stdio spawning with JSON-array command specs and `--cwd`
- inventory counts in the remote `/healthz` endpoint
- optional TOON-style structured output for `api`, `spec`, and `graphql`
- checksum verification in the npm wrapper installer
- Homebrew tap guidance under `packaging/homebrew/README.md`

### Changed

- MCP-to-CLI docs now describe the full bridge contract for tools, prompts, and resources
- distribution docs now treat crates.io and GitHub Releases as canonical, with npm/Homebrew as convenience channels

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Regression coverage for project-local `.claude/skills` when bridged through
  `sxmc stdio "sxmc serve"`
- End-to-end validation notes for the `0.1.1` regressions and `0.1.2` fixes
- Patch release notes and release guidance for the `0.1.2` line

### Fixed

- Project-local skill script execution now resolves to absolute paths without
  requiring an explicit `--paths`
- OpenAPI 3 specs with relative `servers[0].url` values now resolve correctly
  against the spec source URL
- The new project-local skill regression test now uses OS-native temp scripts,
  so CI stays green on Windows as well as Unix

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Crate-level documentation for docs.rs
- Links to crates.io and docs.rs in README

### Fixed

- MCP client for stdio and HTTP transports (`sxmc stdio`, `sxmc http`)
- OpenAPI and GraphQL auto-detection and CLI execution (`sxmc api`, `sxmc spec`, `sxmc graphql`)
- Security scanning for skills and MCP servers (`sxmc scan`)
- Connection baking for saved configs (`sxmc bake`)
